#Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
  vec_numeric = rnorm(8)
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0
  vec_char = c("a","a","a","a","a","a","a","")
  vec_factor = factor(c("a","a","b","b","b","c","c","c"))
hm1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric,
  vec_logical,
  vec_char,
  vec_factor
)

mean(hm1_df$vec_numeric)
mean(hm1_df$vec_logical)
mean(hm1_df$vec_char)
mean(hm1_df$vec_factor)
```
The numeric vector and logical vector work but character and factor vector don't work.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
num_log = as.numeric(vec_logical) 
num_char = as.numeric(vec_char) 
num_factor = as.numeric(vec_factor)

```
The "False" of the logical vector became "0", the "TRUE" of the logical vector became "1". And we cannot change character vector into numeric vector. The factor vector is changed to numeric vector by its levels.
```{r}

as.numeric(vec_logical) * vec_numeric
as.factor(vec_logical) * vec_numeric
as.numeric(as.factor(vec_logical)) * vec_numeric
```
